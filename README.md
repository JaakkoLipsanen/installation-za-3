# installation za-3

[**Play here**](http://flai.xyz/installation-za-3/)

installation za-3 is a game that I made for Ludum Dare #29 game jam in 72 hours in the spring of 2014. The game was made using Unity3D game engine, with no third party assets.

It's an sidescroller shooter set in space. An outer planet outpost, installation za-3, is overrun by alien species. You must escape from the planet :) !

PS. The Unity3D web player plugin is deprecated and no longer works on all browsers. It should still work on Firefox at least (1/2017)
